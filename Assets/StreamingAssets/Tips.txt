Did you know this game was supposed to be called Brazilian Bumper Lift!? Unfortunately you will have to wait for the DLC now.
Mods belong to different classes. Mods in the same class have attributes that can help each other, so maybe think of investing into Mods in the same class!
You can earn Nuts and Bolts by doing different things. Placement in race, destroying other cars, gambling. It's up to you to decide what will make you the most money.
The amplifier class of Mods cant be seen on track, but you can see it in other areas like your Nuts and Bolts payout and in your placements!
The weapon class gives Max ways of performing some ...aggressive defense... This is ideal for taking out those pesky Italian cars. Since when do they know how to make cars anyway!
"Stat" Mods increase you base attributes. This lets you be a better racer by being faster, resisting damage, and having an easier time on track. But you don't need that now do you future world champion.
"Trap" Mods let you get rid of that extra weight in your car. Trust me, you don't need that gearbox... or spark plugs... or that pipe bomb... Yeah, that last one is defiantly someone else's problem.
There are two stores, one for winners who have to pay premium, and another for losers who get pity prices. Get your money up and that won't be a problem... wait, what do you mean you're broke?
Not much is known about the secretive head of the Italian Mafia, but it is said that in another life he was a racer. The few who know him describe him as a “Torro Rosso,” and he is not someone you would want to cross paths with.
Max is not a racer. He is simply a gambler. After having an unlucky streak and losing it all (he is very close to hitting it big), he got into debt with The Mafia. You got him this time though right?
Drifting is a powerful tool. You can gain some (il)legal racing speed on turns or even on straights! Timing is everything though, just remember, turn left to go right!
